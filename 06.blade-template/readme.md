# Laravel Blade

**Laravel Blade is a templating engine that is included with the Laravel PHP framework. It allows developers to create reusable views and templates for their web applications. Blade is a powerful tool that simplifies the process of building and maintaining web applications by providing a way to separate the application's logic from its presentation layer.**

**Blade templates are written in plain PHP code and use a simple syntax that makes them easy to read and write. Blade templates use the .blade.php file extension, and are stored in the resources/views directory of a Laravel application.**
